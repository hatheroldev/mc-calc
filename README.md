# Emacs Package mc-calc

This package allows the use of calc in regions with multiple cursors.

## Installation

Someday mc-calc can be installed through `package.el`.

It will be available on [MELPA](<http://melpa.org/>) and probably [MELPA Stable](<http://stable.melpa.org>):

M-x package-install mc-calc

The package depends on the `multiple-cursors` package, so if you do not use
`package.el`, you would need to install that too.

## Documentation

Please use `M-x finder-commentary mc-calc` for documentation.

## Testing

Execute:

```shell
./do-test.sh
```
